# `fc`

`fc` is a handmade collection of fonts you can use for your next website (or, well, anything).

## Why?

Because I was tired of having to keep track of good fonts to use.

## How can I contribute?

If you would like to contribute, just submit a pull request.

Things that I would like to be contributed:

* Names (currently, they're named `1`, `2`, etc.)
* Font ideas (duh)


## Where did I get the fonts?

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
## What does the name stand for?

**F**ont **C**ollection
